        <h2>Unexpected Development</h2>

        <p>So I started in a new project in my company. We're using ASP.NET MVC as the framework for an internal website for a foreign client. I didn't expect to learn ASP.NET or C# for that matter in my work, but I'm thankful for my bosses for allowing me, a beginner developer, to work on this project. I also like that this project is from scratch, so I can learn web programming with the stack from the ground up. Although, I think I would learn more if the deadline isn't too soon. The short timespan is forcing the team to make shortcuts and not follow all the processes and best practices to meet the deliverables.</p>

        <p>Combined with one subject at school, I feel the information overload and the pressure. Now I know that I can't handle too much pressure and too tight of a deadline. But I have no choice but to adapt. I also wasted too much time on idle tweaking of my development environment, random internet stuff, and configuring my build to work. I am learning to cope with moving fast to deliver finished tasks on time, and fixing what is broken. I read in a blog post that people need to fix what is broken instead of complaining about it. And actions speak louder than complaining.</p>

        <p>More actions, more results, less complaining. Note to self. </p>
