Mobile apps and making things more convenient

Today is my first time to book a condo unit using Airbnb. The process didn't go well so smoothly but all is well. I created my account yesterday and installed the app to my phone. When I tried to book the unit earlier today from my laptop, it prompted me to add a photo of a government ID, then add a selfie. I added the photo but had a problem with the selfie. When I selected the "Add selfie from Airbnb app", it sent me a link even though I already installed the Airbnb app. When I tried to do the booking process on my phone through the app, I was prompted to upload again the government ID photo and a selfie. Minor hassle, but I got through it.

This convenience wasn't available in the past (maybe ~10-20 years ago). If you wanted to book a room, you'll call a hotel and ask for a reservation. Bummer if you don't have a landline phone back then. Just like Uber wasn't available back then. Today, you can book a room (Airbnb), a car (Uber), and a lot of other things using your phone. It's so easy to fulfill personal demands like these using the latest technology.

But with all these conveniences, we should be mindful of using technology. We may become too dependent on it. Or in the worst case, addicted to it.
