Productivity, and deliberating over trivial things

Most of the time, I find myself optimizing my tools, tasks, and other things without creating or producing something.

I'm guilty of this "bike-shedding" recently while choosing what text editor will I use for a long time. I deliberated for days, and switching between notepad++ or sublime text, vim (gvim/terminal vim), and emacs. I tried using all and became more productive with vim or emacs, as they're more powerful for text editing. I chose vim because too much key modifier use in emacs makes my left hand painful, even with the Ctrl-to-Caps-Lock switch. There's a lingering thought that if I settled with vim, I'll miss out on some features of emacs, or other editors. But that's not important right now.

I'm settling with vim for now, and pour my energy and focus to things that matter more. Like learning how to program properly. And studying CS theory for grad school. When I started learning to program, I also tried to learn these ancient text editors (vim and emacs) that's supposed to make me more productive. It was a bad idea. If I focused first on learning to program, regardless of the editor I'm using, I'll be more productive at work and with potential side projects. I'll also be able to have more time and energy for studying instead of using my brain and willpower for a mundane decision like choosing my text editor.

I guess the takeaway here is this: be focused on what you really want to accomplish. Concentrate, and never take off your eyes on what you want. I wanted to learn to program and be a decent programmer, but I procrastinated and instead deliberated with which editor I'll be using for programming. Having goals for what you want are also helpful in achieving this. And for procrastination, procrastinate on a lesser, but important goal. This allows you to be productive even if you're not 100 percent on goal number 1.
